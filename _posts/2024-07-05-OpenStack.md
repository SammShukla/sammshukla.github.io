# CLOUD COMPUTING :

- Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

- Types of Cloud Computing Services-
- Cloud services are typically categorized into three main models:

   - 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
   - 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
   - 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)


- INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE : (IaaS)

- IaaS is the most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

- Key Features of IaaS:

- Virtualized Computing Resources: Users can rent virtual machines or physical servers.
- Scalability: Quickly scale up and down with demand.
- On-Demand and Pay-As-You-Go: Users pay only for what they use.
- Multi-Tenancy: Multiple users can share the same physical infrastructure securely.
- Automated Administrative Tasks: Automated provisioning, managing, and backup systems.
- API Access: Provides APIs to manage and interact with the resources.


- Benefits of IaaS:

- Cost Savings: Reduces the need for physical hardware and associated costs (power, cooling, maintenance).
- Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.
- Flexibility: Allows users to deploy and manage their applications and data in the environment that best suits their needs.
- Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity: Many IaaS providers offer robust disaster recovery and backup solutions.
- Accessibility: Services are accessible over the internet, allowing for remote management and collaboration.


- Common IaaS Providers:

- Openstack
- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
- Microsoft Azure: Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Blob Storage.
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage.


- Example of Using IaaS:
- A company might use IaaS to host its websites and applications. Instead of purchasing and maintaining physical servers, the company can rent virtual servers from an IaaS provider. The company pays only for the resources it uses and can easily scale its infrastructure as its needs grow or shrink. This setup allows the company to focus on developing and improving its applications rather than managing physical hardware.

# Openstack :
